# A Reintroduction to R

Click the following link which will redirect you onto the Berkeley jupyter hub to refresh, and reintroduce yourself to R.

Once you click the link, please navigate to `w241 > week_01 > 1.8.1_reintroduction.Rmd`. 

http://datahub.berkeley.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FUCB-MIDS%2Fw241&urlpath=rstudio

In the future, rather than exposing this whole link, I will be hiding it somewhat more elegantly. Just so you don't worry.
